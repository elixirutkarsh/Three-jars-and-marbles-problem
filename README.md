# Three-jars-and-marbles-problem
You have three jars, labeled Jar A, Jar B, and Jar C. Each jar contains a mix of red and blue marbles. Jar A contains only red marbles, Jar B contains only blue marbles, and Jar C contains a mix of both red and blue marbles.

You are allowed to select one jar at random and take out one marble. Based on the color of the marble you draw, can you correctly identify which jar is which (Jar A, Jar B, and Jar C)?

Conditions:

The jars are labeled correctly, but the labels are hidden from you.
You can only draw one marble from one jar.
How can you identify each jar correctly based on the marble you draw?

Solution:

Draw a marble from Jar A. If the marble is red, then Jar A must be the jar containing only red marbles. If the marble is blue, then it means Jar A cannot be the jar containing only red marbles. Move on to Step 2.

Now, draw a marble from Jar B. If the marble is blue, then Jar B must be the jar containing only blue marbles. If the marble is red, then it means Jar B cannot be the jar containing only blue marbles. Move on to Step 3.

The last jar remaining (Jar C) must be the one with a mix of both red and blue marbles.

Explanation:
Since all jars are labeled correctly but the labels are hidden, there are two possibilities for the label arrangement:

Jar A is labeled Jar B, Jar B is labeled Jar C, and Jar C is labeled Jar A.
Jar A is labeled Jar C, Jar B is labeled Jar A, and Jar C is labeled Jar B.
